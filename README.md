# speech-to-text-data-collection

Speech recognition technology allows for hands-free control of smartphones, speakers, and even vehicles in a wide variety of languages. Companies have moved towards the goal of
enabling machines to understand and respond to more and more of our verbalized commands. There are many matured speech recognition systems available, such as Google Assistant,
Amazon Alexa, and Apple’s Siri. However, all of those voice assistants work for limited languages only. The purpose of this week’s challenge is to build a data engineering
pipeline that allows recording millions of Amharic and Swahili speakers reading digital texts in-app and web platforms.
