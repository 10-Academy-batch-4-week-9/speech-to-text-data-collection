# speech-to-text-data-collection

## Introduction

<p> In todayâ€™s data-driven world of cut-throat competition, creating, executing and monitoring different tasks and large volumes of data is no small feat. Most companies, hence need an automated solution, that will help them manage their daily tasks. </p>

<p>The Apache Kafka and Airflow are open-source task management platforms that help companies create seamlessly functioning workflows to organise, execute and monitor their tasks. Although these platforms seem to perform related tasks, some crucial differences between the two set up them apart. Spark Streaming API enables scalable, high-throughput, fault-tolerant stream processing of live data streams. Data can be ingested from many sources like Kafka. </p>

<p>Our responsibility was to build a tool that can be deployed to process posting and receiving text and audio files from and into a data lake, apply transformation in a distributed manner, and load it into a warehouse in a suitable format to train a speech-t0-text model..</p>
